# Hackathon Project: Steam Games API Dashboard
## Submission for BuildingBloCS May Hackathon 2024

Our team of 3 created this project to determine which genre of games on Steam is the most successful.

We referenced the Steam web api to collect data from Steam.

To run this, first clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/minhtribui153/steam-games-dashboard
cd steam-games-dashboard
```

Then, install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Deploy dashboard:
```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```
The console should automatically redirect you to the dashboard.
If it does not, click the link in the output to direct yourself to the dashboard.
