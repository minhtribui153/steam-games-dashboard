# Hackathon Project: Steam Games API Dashboard
## Submission for BuildingBloCS May Hackathon 2024

Our team of 3 created this project to determine which genre of games on Steam is the most successful.

We referenced the Steam web api to collect data from Steam.

To use, run find_games.py first
Then, run *streamlit run dashboard.py*
The console should automatically redirect you to the dashboard.
If it does not, click the link to direct yourself to the dashboard.
